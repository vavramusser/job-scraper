# JobScrape
Automated job scraper for personal use. This repository includes a series of webscrapers designed to extract job posting information for specific organizations which is then stored to a database. The app.py application launches a web-based viewer listing all jobs in the database with basic information and links to the original job posting.

This project was designed to support my personal job search by automating routine checks on job sites for specific organizations that interest me.
